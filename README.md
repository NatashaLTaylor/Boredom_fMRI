# Boredom_fMRI
Trait Boredom fMRI Analysis

The following repository is in relation to the analysis of the Human Connectome Project (HCP - YOUNG ADULTS) - resting-state fMRI data and assocaited differences in trait-boredom. 

All data is accessible via https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult

We used the minimally pre-processed data from  10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.127

All relevant code for the time-series extraction & calculation of dynamic functional connectivity (MTD) - is available under the folder "server".

All relevant code for the statistical analysis and graph theoretical analysis of the data is available under "analysis".

Code relevant for the creation of figures is under "figures" folder.
